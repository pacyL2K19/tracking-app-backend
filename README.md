# Tracking App Api built with Ruby on Rails

## About the Project

This REST API was built with Ruby on Rails, and Postgres for the databases as the final project at Microverse. With this API, records (measurements) and items (things to measure) can be added, edited, and removed manually interacting with the database in the front-end application.

Please check how this API work in the [Tracking App with React](https://github.com/pacyL2K19/tracking-app-frontend) which is the front-end application built with React, corresponds to this API.

- The database has 3 tables and models for User, Item, and Record
  - Users table has username, password, and admin(boolean) columns
  - Items table has title, unit, icon, and target columns
  - Records table has date, result, item_id, and user_id
- To authorize users, this app uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [Rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors)

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

3. Copy the project URL as displayed.
4. If you're running the Windows Operating System, open your command prompt. On Linux, Open your terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Leave as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. <br>
   e.g. $ git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/yourProjectName
7. Press Enter. Your local copy will be created.
8. To install all dependencies and necessary gems and node packages
   - `bundler install`
   - `yarn install`
9. Run `rails db:setup`
10. Run `rails server` to run rails application in your local server
11. Run `rspec` to run rspec tests

## Interact with this API

1. Go to puma.rb in config/initializers, and rewrite the port from 3000 to 3001 like below:
   e.g. `port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3001 }`

2. Go to cors.rb in config/initializers, and rewrite the origins path for your frontend path in both local and production

## Authentication

- To manage records and items, it needs to log in with a username and a password. Then, you need to include a token, which is issued and passed by logged in, in the header when interacting with this API like below:
  `headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, },`
- Plus, to manage items, it needs to log in with the user account with the admin: true
